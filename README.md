# LeetCode Solutions

Welcome to the LeetCode repository! This repository contains solutions to various LeetCode problems, along with PDFs of the corresponding questions. 

## What's Inside

- **Answered LeetCode Questions:** Each file in this repository is named after the question it solves, with an indication of its runtime performance in milliseconds (ms). The lower the runtime, the better the performance.
- **Question PDFs:** Alongside each solution, you'll find a PDF file containing the detailed description of the problem for easy reference.

## How to Use

1. **Navigate the Repository:** Browse through the repository to find solutions categorized by problem type or difficulty level.
2. **View Solutions:** Open any solution file to view the code and understand the approach used to solve the problem.
3. **Check Performance:** The filename includes the runtime in milliseconds (e.g., `TwoSum_15ms.java`), so you can quickly gauge the efficiency of the solution.
4. **Read Questions:** Refer to the accompanying PDF files for the full problem statement and requirements.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome! If you have a more efficient solution or an alternative approach to a problem, feel free to open a pull request. Please include the runtime of your solution in the filename and ensure it is well-documented.
